                    <p>In november of 2019 I was directed to the Advent of Code website and found it interesting so I decided to follow it the best I could
                     and use it as an oppurnity to sharpen my C# skills.
                    <p>Unfortunately life is far busier than I would like so I could not complete the puzzles as they were released but have been working on them when I can.</p>
                    <p>Around the time I finished day 11 I decided to start a second repo and work through the puzzles in Python as well as a learning process.</p>
